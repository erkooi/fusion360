# Points file for snail sketches defines:
# - sketch of snail using spline, line, circle and offset_curve.
# - three similar sketches each on another origine offset plane.
#
# Points file can define multiple CSV files, each CSV file can only contain
# one object from validFileTypes. A python script converts the points file
# into separate CSV files that can be read into Fusion360. The points file
# keeps all the objects for the design together, which is easier to maintain
# then separate CSV files. The separate CSV files allow reading a single 
# object into Fusion360 or a group of CSV files.
#
# Difference between points file and output CSV files:
# - Omit units = 'mm', because it is defined in snail_points.py
# - Specifiy destination folder of the CSV file after the file type
# - Derive CSV sketch file name from planeNormal + '_' + planeOffset + '_' +
#   sketchName. Omit sketchName string in the CSV file.
