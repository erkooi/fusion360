# Build design component for the different parts of the F35B plane defined
# by a list of assembly CSV files. Each assembly CSV file defines a part of
# the timeline actions in Fusion360. In order the assembly CSV files construct
# the timeline for the entire F35B-CSV design.
#
# First line: 'design' as filetype,
#             foldername of the design CSV file,
#             filename of the design CSV file,
#             name of the design component.
#
# The design CSV file is written in foldername/filename.csv. The 'design',
# filename, and design component name are passed on in the design CSV file.
# The foldername is not passed on in the design CSV file.
